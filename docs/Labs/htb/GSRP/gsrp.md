# What is Ghost Shell Replay Protocol

Ghost Shell Replay Protocol is a methodology created by haxrbyte, with which when you are working on a machine you engage in uninterrupted, full-focus analysis for a 45 minute window. If you are stuck before this point, or at this point you may look at a writeup, or swap to guided mode on htb, find one hint. Close the writeup and begin the attack path again from memory. Each hint restarts the clock for the 45 minute hint window.

My personal inclusions to the protocol include:

## Pre-engagement hypotheses
- Likely attack surface
- What would surprise me?
- What I expect to fail?

## After Action Report
- What I noticed on replays
- What I incorrectly assumed
- What correction in methodology would I make
