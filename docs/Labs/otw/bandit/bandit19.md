# Goal

The password for the next level is stored in a file **readme** in the homedirectory. Unfortunately, someone has modified **.bashrc** to log you out when you log in with SSH.

# What to Learn
How to send commands from login to auto deploy before log out.

Its the best way I can currently describe this task at this time.
