# Goal
There are two files in the home directory: passwords.old and passwords.new. The password for the next level is in passwords.new and is the only line that has been changed between passwords.old and passwords.new

# What to learn:

The utility 'diff' as it tells the differences between the files?
Per the man page, compare files line by line.
