# Goal
The credentials for the next level can be retrieved by submitting the password of the current level to a port on localhost in the range 31000 to 32000. First find out which of these ports have a server listening on them.

## What to learn
Basic assumptions of this level is the first instance of an exercise in enumeration and an introduction to the nmap utility.  I can reasonably believe that the method of solve remains similar to the previous level with it's syntax as the primary challenge in this level **is** enumeration to find the correct service port to send the password to to reach the next level.
