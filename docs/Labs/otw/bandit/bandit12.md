# Goal
The password for the next level is stored in the file `data.txt`, where all lowercase(a-z) and uppercase(A-Z) letters have been rotated by 13 positions.

## What to learn
A very common cipher called ROT13 is also known as a Caesar Cipher. We need to learn how to navigate rotating the characters as needed through the tools provided in the machine without using outside tools such as websites.

### Tools of Use
- `tr` - translate or delete characters

#### Additional notes:
`tr` - translate, squeeze, and/or delete characters from standard input, writing to standard output. STRING1 and STRING2 specify arrays of characters ARRAY1 and ARRAY2 that control the action.
