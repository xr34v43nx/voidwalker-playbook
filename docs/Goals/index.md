# Goals

- Improve education workflow, do not solve to solve.
- After completing a task, articulate at least one **why** or **how** in my own words.
- If I cannot do this, the task is considered incomplete and must be revisited.
- Notes should capture mechanisms, mistakes, or assumptions - not commands.
