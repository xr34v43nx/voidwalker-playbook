# Voidwalker Playbook

Welcome to my IT / cybersecurity lab playbook.

> Notes are continuously updated.

# About Me
You can call me XR, based on an abbreviation of my handle listed in the url. The purpose of this playbook is to serve as a living learning environment as I learn and expand my notes. It documents my methodology as it evolves, along with my thought process as I navigate through boxes. This project prioritizes understanding over completion and methodology over speed.
